# An Introduction to Interactive Data Visualization in Python
1-hour workshop introducing interactive data visualization in Python using Superstore data.

## Getting Started
This workshop was taught using Google Colab. The full Google Colab jupyter notebook is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oI5VXvDAo_QjvjEghuuXlT1dP1QV-29B?usp=sharing). Note that certain code involving Streamlit will only run well in Google Colab.

This workshop is designed for people with basic familiarity with Python, pandas, and data visualization. It assumes no knowledge about Plotly Express or Streamlit.  

The Google Colab notebook content is also available as a jupyter notebook in the scripts folder titled [Intro_Python_Datavis_Plotly.ipynb](https://github.com/christiebarron/intro-data-vis/blob/main/scripts/Intro_Python_Datavis_Plotly.ipynb)

## Files
Datasets are available in the `data` folder. For ease of use, Streamlit web applications call cleaned data on github rather than cleaning the data in the app.
